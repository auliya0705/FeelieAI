# FEELIE: Emotional Companion AI for Kids 

FEELIE is a simple demo application that illustrates how an AI agent can recognize a child’s emotions and respond empathetically.
The system currently uses a rule-based approach to simulate emotional understanding and supportive responses.

## 🚀 How to Run

### Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/feelie.git
cd feelie 

### Install dependencies
Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed, then run:
pip install pyttsx3

(Optional) You can add other dependencies such as tkinter if not preinstalled on your system.

Run the application

python feelie_app.py

The GUI window will open. You can type your messages into the text box and click “Send 💬” to chat with FEELIE.

## 💬 Try These Demo Inputs

1️⃣ “I’m so mad! My friend Bimo broke my ruler.”
➡️ Background turns red-pink (angry), empathetic validation response.

2️⃣ “I really sad when it broke.”
➡️ Reflective empathy response about frustration.

3️⃣ “I don’t want to fight, but I want him to understand.”
➡️ Encourages calm, gives example of expressing emotions assertively.

4️⃣ “Okay, maybe I’ll say that tomorrow.”
➡️ Breathing + calm exercise guidance 🌬️

5️⃣ “I feel calm now.”
➡️ Warm praise & parental connection suggestion.

6️⃣ “Thank you!”
➡️ Ends with praise & playful suggestion (emotion game or drawing).

## 💡 Note

This prototype demonstrates the core concept of an AI empathy agent.
Although it currently relies on rule-based logic, future versions could integrate machine learning models for real-time emotion detection and personalized empathy learning.
